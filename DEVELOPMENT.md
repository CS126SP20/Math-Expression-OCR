# Development 
Week 1

Got CMake set up, project compiles properly. I started out using the OpenCV cinder block, but then ran into a lot of issues with that. 
The cinder block was very old and there wasn't a lot of support for it, so I switched to using the regular OpenCV library instead. I was able to compile the 
OpenCV library and add it to my project.

Week 2

I decided to pivot my project a little bit to focus on evaluating written mathematical expressions. I decided to use the 
CROHME mathematical symbol dataset. I first had to process the training data, as the dataset comes in the inkml format. I 
converted these images to JPGs. I created an Image class to represent a single image.
